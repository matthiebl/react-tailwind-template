# react-tailwind-template

This is a quick template to use that has most requirements needed for a React application. It is bootstrapped and bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with all the needed plugins and configurations set up!

Simply use this repo as a template to start your own app with these basics ready to go!
